//////////////////PROBLEM 3////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitInitDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git init' does.
*/

//CODE HERE
let gitInitDefinition = "Git init initializes the git instance in whatever folder you are currently in and essentially creates a local repository. This allows git to keep track of the changes made to the files and code within that folder."
//////////////////PROBLEM 4////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitCloneDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git clone' does.

    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git commit' does.

    Create a variable called 'gitCommitCode'.  
    It should be a string containing the code to commit using the message "initial commit".
*/

//CODE HERE
let gitCommitDefinition = "Git commit creates a snapshot of the files that you are tracking in your directory or repository"
